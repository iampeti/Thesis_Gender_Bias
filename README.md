**Abstract:**

â€‹
This thesis aims to investigate the impact of gender bias in clinical research, with a
focus on differences in gene expression. The historical exclusion of females in clinical
trials and drug testing has led to significant disparities in healthcare outcomes. To explore
this issue, this thesis statistically analyzes gender-based differences in gene expression
across various conditions. A few basic theoretical concepts are explained before presenting
the methodology used. Using datasets from the GEO database, hypothesis testing is
conducted separately for each dataset. Linear models, applied through the limma package
in R, identify significantly differentially expressed genes between genders. The results are
presented and visualized, highlighting the extent of gender-specific variations in gene
expression.
